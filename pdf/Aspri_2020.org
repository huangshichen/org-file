preprocessing:
+ Images are merged by VHR-RGB and HSI tiles, and resized patches of size 25*25 along with HSI image to match the size of ground turth data.
+ samples are cropped out by sliding through images with size 25*25 window.
+ 8000samples.
+ 400

dataset:
dataset was collected by NCALM, contains huperspectral(HSI) and Very High Resolution RGB imagery(VHR-RGB)

224*224*6 satellite images test on FCN-[VGG-16, ResNet-101, GoogLeNet]


dataset used in this work was originally described in sometext, and is briefly described here

learning rate: 10^-4, 10^-5, 10^-9. 10^-4 get the best result for first 100 epochs, and reducing the learning rate to 10^-5 for another 100 epochs

train smaples: 18,054 images.
validation: 958 images.
